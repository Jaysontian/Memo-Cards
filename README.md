## ðŸ—‚ Memo Cards
A memory app that helps you remember concepts better with spaced repetition.

### What is spaced repetition?
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review and testing of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.

### What does this app do?
This app allows users to create different types of flashcards, including terms, diagrams, cloze text, and test themselves using spaced repetition. If cards are successfully recalled, the time between the next test will increase by a certain interval. If it was forgotten, the time will shorten by a half!
